# IG021G - Business Models

Business development with a focus on identifying, developing and communicating business plans.

In this course, I created a business plan for a fictitious company called [Br√•ttom.se](https://github.com/albinronnkvist/Course_IG021G_BusinessModels/blob/main/business-model_brattam-se.pdf), a digital platform that connects buyers and sellers of fast services. The platform prioritizes time efficiency through a specialized search engine and streamlines the purchasing process and administrative tasks with digital tools. I did market research, competitor analysis, business environment analysis and used literature to develop strategies for positioning, marketing and much more so that the company could succeed in reality. I also planned the company's finances with sales forecasts, profit budget and liquidity budgets.
