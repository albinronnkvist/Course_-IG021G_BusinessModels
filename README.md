# IG021G - Business Models

Industrial Engineering and Management Ba (A), Business Models, 7.5 credits

In this course, I created a business plan for a fictitious company. I did market research, competitor analysis, business environment analysis and used literature to develop strategies for positioning, marketing and much more so that the company could succeed in reality. I also planned the company's finances with sales forecasts, profit budget and liquidity budgets.
